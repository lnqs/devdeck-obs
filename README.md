# OBS controls for devdeck

Plugin providing some OBS controls for devdeck (<https://github.com/jamesridgway/devdeck>).

Hacked together in one evening and in a works-on-my-machineâ„¢ state.

No docs yet.

No tests.

But probably several issues. Shutdowns that aren't working cleanly, for example.

Anyway it already could use some cleanup and dry.

Maybe it'll get some more love at some point. And maybe someone finds this interesting.
