# OBS controls for devdeck

Plugin providing some OBS controls for devdeck (<https://github.com/jamesridgway/devdeck>).

Hacked together in one evening and in a works-on-my-machineâ„¢ state.

No docs yet.

No tests.

But probably several issues. Shutdowns that aren't working cleanly, for example.

Anyway it already could use some cleanup and dry.

And due to https://github.com/lnqs/knoepfe it'll probably won't get any love anymore.
